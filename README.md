# Pays.Host Alternative Self-Bot
Create an image host for Discord with custom domains, with a python self-bot!

## Help
- If you need help with this, DM me on Discord at ! Misspoken#7357 ! My main got disabled LOL 

## Usage
- Head over to `main.py` and put your token where it says `YOUR_TOKEN`. (Line 7)
- Customize a prefix if you want so you can trigger the <prefix>embed. (Line 9)
- Put a title of your embed, footer, and link.
- Run the project and go to Discord and do your prefix and embed together.

```Example: +embed <link>
